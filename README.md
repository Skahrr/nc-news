# Northcoders News Project

## About

This website relies on the API mentioned under this (you can have a look either to the repo or to the hosted version *more info on it's readme.md*).
You can see all the news we got on the database, as well as filter by topic. You also have a more specific filter where you can sort and order the news you looking at.

You can have a look at the hosted version of this app here:
https://best-nc-news.netlify.app/articles (we recommend to check this page on mobile version)
